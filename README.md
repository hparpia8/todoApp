# Artisanal Todo

A simple, local-only macOS todo app with a warm pen-and-paper feel.

- One continuous scrollable page — active tasks at the bottom, history above
- Fully offline — data never leaves your machine
- macOS desktop widget (3, 5, or 10 tasks at a glance)
- Light, Dark, and Auto (follows system) appearance modes

**Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.**

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hparpia8/todoApp/main/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads the latest release from GitHub Releases and copies it to `/Applications`. You'll be prompted to launch the app when done.

> **Note:** The curl installer requires a published GitHub Release with a `TodoApp.dmg` attached. See [Publishing a release](#publishing-a-release) below.

## How to use

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Type in the bottom bar + press **Return** | Adds a task |
| Click the circle next to a task | Marks it complete — moves to history |
| Click a completed circle | Restores the task to active |
| Scroll up | Browse all completed history |
| Right-click a task | Delete it |
| ☀ · ◑ · ☾ buttons in the header | Switch Light / Auto / Dark mode |

### Adding the widget

1. Right-click your macOS desktop → **Edit Widgets**
2. Search for **Artisanal Todo**
3. Choose Small (3 tasks), Medium (5), or Large (10)

> The widget requires the app to be installed and launched at least once. For live data, the app must be signed with an Apple Developer account (see [Widget & signing](#widget--signing)).

## Build & test locally

**Prerequisites:** Xcode 15+, Homebrew

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hparpia8/todoApp.git
cd todoApp
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` installs [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) via Homebrew and generates `TodoApp.xcodeproj`.

Then open in Xcode:

```bash
open TodoApp.xcodeproj
```

**Important:** In Xcode's toolbar, make sure the scheme is set to **TodoApp** (not `TodoWidgetExtension`) before pressing ⌘R.

```
[TodoApp] > [My Mac]   ▶
```

### Using make

```bash
make setup    # install XcodeGen + generate project
make open     # open in Xcode
make build    # build from the terminal
make archive  # build a release archive
make clean    # remove generated project + build output
```

### Running from the terminal (after building)

```bash
make build
# the app binary lands in Xcode's DerivedData — open it from Xcode with ⌘R
```

## Data storage

| Build type | Storage location |
|------------|-----------------|
| Signed (Apple Developer account) | `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.artisanal.todo/todos.json` |
| Unsigned / development | `~/Library/Application Support/ArtisanalTodo/todos.json` |

To inspect your data at any time:

```bash
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/ArtisanalTodo/todos.json
```

---

## Widget & signing

The WidgetKit extension is always sandboxed by macOS. For the widget to read live data from the app, both targets must share an **App Group** (`group.com.artisanal.todo`), which requires a valid Apple Developer account.

**To enable for App Store / signed distribution:**

1. Add your Team ID in Xcode → Signing & Capabilities
2. Create the App Group `group.com.artisanal.todo` in your [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/applicationGroup)
3. In both entitlements files, uncomment the App Groups section:
   ```xml
   <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>
   <array><string>group.com.artisanal.todo</string></array>
   ```
4. Enable sandbox in `TodoApp.entitlements` (`com.apple.security.app-sandbox = true`)

For unsigned/development builds the widget shows placeholder data — the main app works fully.

---

## Publishing a release

To make the curl installer work:

1. Archive the app: `make archive` (or Xcode → Product → Archive)
2. Export `TodoApp.app` from the archive
3. Wrap it in a DMG named `TodoApp.dmg`
4. Create a GitHub Release and attach `TodoApp.dmg`

The install script automatically fetches the latest release.

## Project structure

```
todoApp/
├── project.yml              XcodeGen spec — source of truth for the Xcode project
├── setup.sh                 Dev setup (installs XcodeGen + generates project)
├── install.sh               Curl-installable release script
├── Makefile                 Build shortcuts
├── TodoApp/
│   ├── App/                 App entry point (@main)
│   ├── Views/               ContentView, TodoRowView
│   ├── Models/              TodoItem (shared with widget), TodoStore
│   ├── Theme/               AppTheme colors + fonts, AppColorScheme enum
│   └── Assets.xcassets/     7 adaptive color sets (light + dark variants)
└── TodoWidget/              WidgetKit extension (Small / Medium / Large)
```

> `TodoApp.xcodeproj` is git-ignored — regenerate it anytime with `xcodegen generate` or `./setup.sh`.
